# TA-RSI-SMA-cross

In this project, I use a combination of RSI and SMA cross as a technical analysis trading strategy for the S&amp;P 500.
During backtesting, I evaluate the strategy by comparing against a buy and hold strategy.
This is the code used to generate the analysis done in my Medium article.
